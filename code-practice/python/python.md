### Notes

- Each problem links to a dedicated Markdown file containing:  
  - Problem description  
  - Solution approach  
  - Python implementation  
  - Test cases  
- Practice in the order: **Easy → Medium → Hard**, and review solutions for optimization insights.  
- This structure simulates **timed coding assessments** often found in Data Engineer interviews.
